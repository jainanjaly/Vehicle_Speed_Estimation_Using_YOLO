# Vehicle Speed Estimation Project
## Project Overview
This machine learning project utilizes YOLOv8 to detect and track vehicles in video frames, trained on a meticulously annotated custom dataset. The system incorporates speed estimation by defining a Region of Interest (ROI) within each frame. Utilizing OpenCV, the ROI enables precise speed calculations based on vehicle displacement over time. The outcome is a powerful combination of vehicle identification, tracking, and real-time speed estimation, applicable for traffic monitoring and law enforcement tasks.

## Model taining

 The model training phase of machine learning project,is a pivotal step where we harness the power of our carefully prepared data to train a robust and effective model. This section provides comprehensive guidance on running the model training script, insight into its functionalities, and an overview of the expected results.

### Execution Instructions

Initiating the model training script is straightforward. Download all the files in the "model_taining folder" and execute the provided "model_training.ipynb" script by running all its cells. 
```
python model_training.ipynb
```
Before running the script, ensure all required dependencies are installed as specified in the project documentation. Additionally, customize any configuration parameters within the script to align with your project objectives.

### Functionality Overview

The model training script orchestrates an iterative learning process over the prepared dataset. It will be trained to detect vehicles like cars and vans, guiding the machine-learning model through multiple epochs to refine its parameters. Notably, the training process is configured to run for ten epochs, each representing a complete pass through the dataset. Additionally, a specific image size (imgsz) of 244 pixels is employed, contributing to the model's ability to extract meaningful features from the input data.

### Expected results

Upon successful execution, expect the script to produce a trained weights file(which will be found in a folder named runs) ready for deployment. The model will have learned from the input data, capturing essential features and relationships, enabling it to make predictions on new, unseen data. The expected results include model performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss, providing insights into the effectiveness of the trained model. These outcomes are critical for evaluating the model's capability to generalize to real-world scenarios and make accurate predictions.
